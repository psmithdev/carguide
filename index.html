          <!-- Each <li> contains an issue and its description -->
          <li>
            <h3>VANOS Issues</h3>
            <p>
              Problems with the variable valve timing system can lead to a lack
              of power at lower rpm, hesitant acceleration, rough idle, and long
              cranking of the cold engine. Fixing the entire unit with a rebuilt
              one may cost around $1800.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>SMG Issues</h3>
            <p>
              The Sequential Manual Gearbox can face issues like trouble
              shifting, jerks at lower speeds, and overheating. Replacing the
              entire gearbox can set you back around $7,000.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Subframe Cracks</h3>
            <p>
              Cracks can appear in the subframe even on cars that haven't been
              raced. Repairing these cracks can be expensive, often costing
              several thousand dollars.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Rod Bearing Issues</h3>
            <p>
              The rod bearings can wear out prematurely, leading to potential
              engine failure. It's recommended to replace them as a preventative
              measure, especially on higher mileage cars.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Valve Adjustments</h3>
            <p>
              Regular valve adjustments are crucial for the S54 engine in the
              E46 M3. Neglecting this can lead to reduced performance and
              potential engine damage.

          <li>
            <h3>Throttle Actuators</h3>
            <p>
              The throttle actuators can fail, leading to reduced performance
              and a check engine light. Replacement is the most common solution.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Rod Bearings</h3>
            <p>
              Like the E46, the E90 M3's rod bearings can wear out prematurely.
              Regular inspection and replacement are recommended.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Idle Control Valve</h3>
            <p>
              The idle control valve can get clogged or fail, leading to rough
              idling or stalling. Cleaning or replacement can fix the issue.

          <!-- Listing issues specific to C6 Corvette ZR1 -->
          <li>
            <h3>Dash Peeling on the 3LZ</h3>
            <p>
              The 3LZ trim, which is the highest luxury level for the C6
              Corvette ZR1, has been reported to have issues with the leather
              dash peeling or delaminating. This can be due to heat, humidity,
              or just age.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Ceramic Brake Vibrations</h3>
            <p>
              The C6 Corvette ZR1's ceramic brakes have been reported to cause
              vibrations during highway driving. This is attributed to the
              brakes not being balanced correctly from the factory that
              manufactured these ceramic brakes. The most effective solution is
              to have the ceramic brakes professionally balanced.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Supercharger Coupler Issues</h3>
            <p>
              The supercharger coupler can wear out over time, leading to a
              rattling noise, especially at idle. Replacing the coupler is the
              most common fix.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Supercharger Bricks Need Reinforcement</h3>
            <p>
              The supercharger on the ZR1 uses intercooler "bricks" to help cool
              the intake air. Over time, these can crack or fail, especially
              under high boost or when using aftermarket pulleys. Reinforcing or
              replacing the bricks with aftermarket solutions can prevent
              failure.

            <h3>Valve Drop Issue</h3>
            <p>
              The LS7 engine in the C6 Z06 has been known to suffer from valve
              drop issues, particularly with the exhaust valves. This can lead
              to catastrophic engine failure.

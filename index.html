            <h3>VANOS Issues</h3>
            <p>
              Problems with the variable valve timing system can lead to a lack
              of power at lower rpm, hesitant acceleration, rough idle, and long
              cranking of the cold engine. Fixing the entire unit with a rebuilt
              one may cost around $1800.
